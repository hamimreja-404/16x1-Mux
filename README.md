# 16x1-Mux
16x1 Multiplexer in Verilog ðŸš€
    This project demonstrates a 16x1 multiplexer designed in Verilog, allowing you to select one of 16 inputs based on a 4-bit control signal. Multiplexers like this are essential in digital systems for     data routing.

Project Contents
    mux_16x1: The main Verilog module implementing the 16x1 MUX.
    mux_16x1_testbench: A testbench that verifies the multiplexerâ€™s functionality with different input patterns.
How It Works
    The mux_16x1 module outputs one of its 16 input lines (in[15:0]) based on the 4-bit select signal, directing the chosen input to out.

Tools
  EDA Tools: Xilinx Vivado
